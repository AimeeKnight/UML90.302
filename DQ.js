"Aha! I see!" PG 203 Tutorial: Animated Dashboard

I'm glad the tutorial intoroduced a problem we might come across and showed how
to use jQuery to implement a solution. 
I will now have a mental note set for jQuery's stop() function and it's ability
to keep DOM events from building up in the queue.
I've found programs can quicly exhibit 
unexpected behavior and I'm happy I now know one potential problem and it's solution. 

"Huh? What was that all about?" PG 196 Easing

Without the explanation from our text, and without jQuery's documantation
a few of the easing options passed to animate might not have been immediatly apparent
to me. This link http://api.jqueryui.com/easings/ helped me to visualize
all of them. I'm assuming the names are related to mathmatical functions,
but if anyone can shed further light on the names i'd definitely be interested in 
learning more.
